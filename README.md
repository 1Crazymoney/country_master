# country_master
Country Level codes for international standards viz. ISO2A, ISO3A, Timezone, IOC, FIFA, MCC, MNC, Currency and more.
Metadata is available in csv, txt ('|' separated), json and xml formats for ease of consumption at user end.
This is a 'current' repository - which means past codes will not be available or versioned either.

MNC Code info:
MNC codes are comma separated. If there is more than one MCC available for that country, then the data is available in mnc'-'mcc format. Else, it is only mcc code only.

Please feel free to raise a jira and fix data inconsistencies if spotted. Kindly provide reference ( source of information ) that forms the basis for requesting the information change.
